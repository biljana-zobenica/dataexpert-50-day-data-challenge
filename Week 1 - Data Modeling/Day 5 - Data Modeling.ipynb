    "### 1 - Your company’s loyalty program database tracks customers who frequently update their contact details such as phone, email, and address over multiple years. To support marketing and compliance audits, you need a data model that preserves the complete history of these changes while enabling fast access to current information. How would you design the data model and schema? How would you query the latest versus historical information? Also, describe your dimensional model schema design and discuss the trade-offs involved."
